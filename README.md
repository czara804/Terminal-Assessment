###Statement of Purpose and Scope
This terminal application is a 'Choose your own adventure' game in a Dungeons & Dragons style that allows the user to make choices throughout the story. The user encounters riddles along the way that will need to be solved to move on or will result in death or looping back to an earlier choice. 
The main point of the game is fun! The application is fantasy based with references and nods to popular fandoms such as Dr. Who, The Hobbit, The Matrix, Harry Potter, and general fairytale tropes. The user is required to read the storyline for clues and identify the correct path through the game to reach Dr. Tempestas castle and retrieve a pass-key. It is part of a trend of puzzle and logic games, along with excape rooms, for an audience ranging from children to adults. There is a level of literacy required, and to help with story flow ascii art has beenn incorporated at main points of the storyline. 

The user will need to download the game and run it in the terminal

Stat_update 3

End of Day 2: 
- have managed to finish code with help for the looping! everything is in methods and the program now loops through path and troll choices, continuing through the narrative
- also fixed the clue for the door puzzle so now it asks if the user wants to quit or get a clue
- still some issues in code with SPACING, calling list of companions from hash/array/value (coming out in array), and with loop. 
Add introduction to a method?
Add GAME OVER for deaths. 
Add WINNER for red pill
- started flow chart on draw.io and up to troll choice. 
- have written the scope and sequence and starting to detail the features. 
- feature changed from progress bar to using ascii images for breaks in writing and to make stages more obvious. Calling castle and mountains from https://www.asciiart.eu/buildings-and-places/castles. No initials or names to credit other than website. 
- have included error handling for images in the situation that calling from txt files doesn't work. Could add extra parameter in txt_image method for alt text. 



Day 3 Plan: 
- finish flow chart
- incorporate the testing methods 
- ascii map? will need to find a suitable one or try draw myself. 
- write help file 
- ARGV - command line input 
- install instructions (script)
